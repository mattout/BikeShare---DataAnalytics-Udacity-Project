# BikeShare---DataAnalytics-Udacity-Project

This is a project I executed in the Udacity Nanodegree Course of Data Analytics Professional to interact with a customer and let him analyze data with python

I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 

I wrote a code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 

I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
